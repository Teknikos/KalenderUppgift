<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>In this project you will find a simple application that displays events on a calendar.</p>
<p>You'll find documentation for the calendar plugin here: <a href="https://fullcalendar.io/docs">https://fullcalendar.io/docs</a></p>
<p>Here are a couple of activities you could perform:</p>

    <li>Add a filter form above the calendar where a user can select from groups and/or users.</li>
    <li>Add a new view component to the navigation where new events can be added.</li>
    <li>
        Add a summary at the bottom of the calendar
        <ul>
            <li>Per group</li>
            <li>Per user</li>
            <li>Per day</li>
            <li>Per hour</li>
            <li>Per event type</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Highlight all events from the same group when hovering over one.</li>
    <li>Change localization to sv-SE for date presentation.</li>
    <li>Create interfaces for types used (events, users, groups) and use it in components instead of 'any'</li>

            <li>Add background color</li>
            <li>Beautify</li>
